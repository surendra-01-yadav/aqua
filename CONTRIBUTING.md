## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/surendra-01-yadav/aqua.git
cd aqua

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies in development mode
pip install -r files/requirements.txt
pip install pytest pytest-cov black flake8

# Format code
black files/

# Run linter
flake8 files/

# Run tests
pytest
```

## Coding Standards

- **Python**: Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- **Naming**: Use descriptive variable and function names
- **Documentation**: Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- **Comments**: Explain the "why", not the "what"
- **Formatting**: Use `black` for code formatting

Example docstring:
```python
def detect_water_bodies(image, confidence_threshold=0.5):
    """
    Detect water bodies in satellite imagery using YOLOv8.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    image : np.ndarray
        Input satellite image in RGB format
    confidence_threshold : float, optional
        Confidence threshold for detections (default: 0.5)
    
    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Detection results with bounding boxes and confidence scores
    """
```

## Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:
```
Add water body detection module

- Implement YOLOv8-based detection
- Add confidence thresholding
- Include GeoJSON output format

Fixes #123
```

## Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=files
```

## Documentation

- Add docstrings to all public functions
- Update configuration examples if applicable
- Include usage examples in docstrings
